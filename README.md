# Portfolio redesign

Intention: use React's single page application to redesign current page

# **Why the need to transform**

Personally I'm not a fan of the layout of my landing and child page.

**The landing page**

On the loading page, I have made use of images as a `<href>` which I feel makes the home page distracting. Additionally, I did consider the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX), and thought about the accessibility of it.  While a normal person might be able to move their cursor over one of the images, what if a user doesn't know where to go. What if they wanted information on me. While the hover effects might add to the user interface and add some flair to the home page, is that worth it at the potential cost of user experience (UX)? 

**Child pages**

For the time being, I have not made much use of the child pages. This can become obvious as a user goes about and peruse through the pages. One noticeable thing is the unused screen real estate, and this is quite noticeable on much bigger screens

**Image sources**

Ideally I want to reduce the images that I use, especially of ones containing pictures of me. As a portfolio page, I want to make it more about my projects and skills. Also additionally, I have noticed that some of these images take a few seconds to load, on part of the larger than expected image size. This is noticeable in my landing page, as the top image tries and loads for the first time.

# Solution

Upon learning React's single page application, my thought turned to how I could potentially transform my page into something more compact, professional, and with a simple minimalist flair. To solve the problems of the above, my thoughts about this project were:

1. Get rid of the landing page and simply convert it to a single page application. No need for the extra pages!
2. Relating to part 1, get rid of images as a `href`. I personally no longer find this to be ideal

For the time being, I have been checking out how portfolio pages could be created using React, and getting some potential design inspiration from those examples
